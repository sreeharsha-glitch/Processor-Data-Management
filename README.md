# Data Visualization and Management Application

Built a single-page application (SPA) that serves as a data visualization and management tool. The application should allow users to visualize data in the form of graphs and tables, along with providing features for data manipulation and comparison.

# Table Management

Developed a table component to display the data retrieved from the API, also including pagination, filtering, search functionality, and lazy loading, allowing users to select 2 rows for comparison purposes and export functionality to download data in CSV format. Integration with a backend server to fetch and update data from a database.

This Graph represents the data between 2 points from the API data.

# Pie Chart Visualization

This Graph represents the data on many cores for each processor. Implemented a functionality on the slider component, the user can view up to 100 processors at a time. Can change the logic in the backend if we need more data to visualize. The next button moves to the next data the user can view the next 10 processors' data.
